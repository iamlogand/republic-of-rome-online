          A Faction is a group of Aligned Senators controlled by a
          Player. Each Faction can be led by a Faction Leader chosen from among
          the Faction Members.

            In the Senate, Members typically Vote as a block to maximize their impact on
            Elections, Proposals and Prosecutions.

            Members can grow the Faction by making Persuasion Attempts against
            Unaligned Senators or Senators Aligned to a rival Faction.

            Each Faction has a Faction Treasury, which is a hidden pool of Talents primarily used to defend Senators from Persuasion Attempts.

            Factions can acquire Secrets, which may be revealed and activated to give the Faction an advantage.

            Only one Faction can win the gameâ€”there are no shared victories.
