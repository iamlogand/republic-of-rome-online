          A Faction is a group of Aligned{" "}
          <TermLink name="Senator" displayName="Senators" /> controlled by a
          Player. Each Faction can be led by a Faction Leader chosen from among
          the Faction Members.

            In the Senate, Members typically Vote as a block to maximize their
            impact on Proposals.
          </li>
          <li>
            Members can grow the Faction by making Persuasion Attempts against
            Unaligned Senators or Senators Aligned to a rival Faction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each Faction has a Faction Treasury, which is a hidden pool of
            Talents primarily used to defend Members from Persuasion Attempts.
