# Orthographic guidelines

## Spelling

For English words use American spelling because _Republic of Rome_ is an American game and American English is widely used across the internet.

## Capitalization

Avoid overuse of capitalization, except for the following words that should always be capitalized:

- "State" when referring to the Roman State (Res Publica)
- "Senate" when referring to the Roman Senate
- Place names, such as "Rome" or "Macedonia"
- Place name adjectives, such as "Roman" or "Macedonian"
- Historical wars, such as "1st Punic War"
- Historical families and individuals, such as "Cornelius", "P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus" or "Hannibal"
- Legion names, such as "Legion V"
- The names of specific individual factions, such as "Faction 1"
- These offices:
  - Censor
  - Consul for Life
  - Dictator
  - Field Consul
  - Master of Horse
  - Pontifex Maximus
  - Rome Consul

_Note the absence of "highest ranking available official", "priest", "prior consul" and "proconsul" from the above list._

Other words should still be capitalized in the usual places, such as at the start of a sentence, bullet point or other UI item.

## Talents

Talents can be referred to as "talents" or "T", for example:

- Fabius has 8 talents in his personal treasury
- Valerius lost 3T by placing a bad bet at the circus
